This is code that a Wii game mod running with BrainSlug, or possibly other
code modification frameworks with the right tinkering, or even homebrew via
libogc, can use to interface with the /dev/dolphin device exposed by the
Dolphin Emulator.

Use for whatever, no license, no warranty, etc. Have fun!

To use, bundle dolphin.c/dolphin.h with your mod. Eventually I'd like to make
it a proper library but that's not necessary right now.
